Imager-SkinDetector

Have you ever needed to know if an image has some amount of
skin tone color? Did you find some tool to do it?
Free software? If so, please tell me which one!

If not, welcome to Imager-SkinDetector. It uses Imager as
processing engine, so it has a decent speed.
Don't expect miracles, though.

I'm planning to use this as part of a set of tools
to automatically classify images as nudity or
"containing skin". It's only a plan. I might succeed
one day. Most probably I won't. :-)

Feel free to provide feedback and code.
