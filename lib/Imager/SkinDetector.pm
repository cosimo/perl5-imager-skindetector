=head1 NAME

Imager::SkinDetector - Try to detect skin tones and nudity in images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Imager::SkinDetector;

    # Use whatever format your Imager supports
    my $name = 'mypic.png';

    # Check a local file
    my $image = Imager::SkinDetector->new(file => $name)
        or die "Can't load image [$name]\n";

    # ... or download a remote picture via HTTP
    my $image = Imager::SkinDetector->new(url => 'http://some.server/some.pic')
        or die "Can't load image!\n";

    my $skinniness = $image->skinniness();
    printf "Image is %3.2f%% skinny\n", $skinniness * 100;

    my $prob = $image->contains_nudity();
    printf "Contains nudity with a %.2f%% probability\n", $prob * 100;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Have you ever needed to know if an image has some amount of
skin tone color? Did you find some tool to do it?
Free software? Yes? If so, please tell me right now!

If not, welcome to Imager-SkinDetector. It uses Imager as
processing engine, so it should have a decent speed.
Don't expect miracles, though.

I'm planning to use this as part of a set of tools
to automatically classify images as nudity or
"containing skin". It's only a plan. I might succeed
one day. Most probably I won't. :-)

Feel free to provide feedback and code.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<is_skin($color)>

Examines an C<Imager::Color> object and tells you if it
seems to be similar to skin color.

The algorithm is as stupid as you can get. No less.
And it only detects "white" skin colors for now. Sorry.

Example:

    my $color = Imager::Color->new(0, 255, 255);
    if (Imager::SkinDetector::is_skin($color)) {
        print 'Yes, it seems to be skinny';
    } else {
        print 'Mmhhh, probably not';
    }

=head2 C<rgb2hsv(@rgb)>

Converts an RGB triplet into HSV, returned as a list of values.
C<H> is hue, 0 to 360.
C<S> is saturation, 0 to 1.
C<V> is value, 0 to 255.

Example:

    my @rgb = (255, 0, 0);
    my @hsv = Imager::SkinDetector::rgb2hsv(@rgb);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<contains_nudity()>

Tries to detect if image contains nudity,
by using all available methods, like C<hue_frequencies()>
and C<skinniness()>, and trying to combine their results
into something reasonable.

Returns a real value between 0 and 1.

The algorithm is basically crap, so I would be seriously
surprised if it works even for a small percentage of the
images you throw at it.

Anyway, feel free to send me interesting test cases :-)

=head2 C<hue_frequencies()>

Examines the image and returns a list of 36 relative frequencies
for color hues in the picture.

Now it outputs 36 values, corresponding to 36 intervals
in the entire spectrum, conventionally ranged from 0 to 360,
where first interval corresponds to red.

The relation between hue and number is approximately as follows:

    Hue value   Color
    ----------------------
    0 - 60	    red
    60 - 120	yellow
    120 - 180	green
    180 - 240	cyan
    240 - 300   blue
    300 - 360   magenta

=head2 C<is_fuzzy()>

Return a floating point value that tries to represent
how "fuzzy" your image is. The higher the number, the
"fuzzier" the image.

I don't know how to explain what I mean by "fuzzy", but
probably an example can:

http://search.cpan.org/src/COSIMO/Imager-SkinDetector-0.05/examples/fractal.gif

While this other one has a very low "fuzzy" factor:

http://search.cpan.org/src/COSIMO/Imager-SkinDetector-0.05/examples/sand.jpg

=head2 C<skinniness()>

Returns a real value from 0 to 1, indicating how much skin
tone color is present in the given picture.
A return value of zero means no skin tone colors.
A return value of one means a picture that contains only skin
colors.

Example:

    # You might not be able to load '.png' pictures,
    # depending on your version of Imager and OS
    my $pic = 'coolpic.png';
    my $img = Imager::SkinDetector->new(file => $pic);
    my $skin = $img->skinniness();

    # $skin = 0.21313   -> 21.3% of skin colors
